# Bottleneck

Julia code to compute the founder population of a viral population in an infected individual (transmission bottleneck). Takes as input, sequence read counts at selected sites of all variants in donor-recipient pairs. Outputs the Bayesian posterior for the founder population for each pair and an estimate over all pairs using a Bayesian hierarchical model. The model is a modified version of the BetaBinomial model proposed by Leonard, Ashley Sobel, Daniel B. Weissman, Benjamin Greenbaum, Elodie Ghedin, and Katia Koelle. “Transmission Bottleneck Size Estimation from Pathogen Deep-Sequencing Data, with an Application to Human Influenza A Virus.” Journal of Virology 91, no. 14 (July 15, 2017). https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00171-17.
